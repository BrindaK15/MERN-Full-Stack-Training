### Attack on Titan Next.js Project 

This repository documents the completion of a full-stack front-end development project built with Next.js and focused on advanced React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS concepts. The project theme is a tribute to the anime/manga Attack on Titan.


### Step 1: The Digital Canvas Summary
This first step established the foundation of the project by creating the primary visual asset: a dramatic, full-page tribute to Attack on Titan.

### Key Achievements
Next.js Page Structure: Created the main component in app/aot-tribute-page/page.tsx using modern JSX syntax.

Next.js Image Optimization: Used the next/image component for optimal image loading and performance, specifically employing the fill property for the hero section.

### Dramatic Styling: Applied extensive Tailwind CSS to achieve a dark, high-contrast aesthetic:

Custom color definitions (AOT_RED, AOT_YELLOW).

Full-height hero section with image overlay and subtle hover effects (group-hover:scale-105).

Responsive typography and layout to ensure readability on all devices.

Content: Included the core page elements:

A grand header (Attack on Titan).

A core plot summary overlaid on the hero image.

A visual character list of the Survey Corps Elite with small, stylized icons.
